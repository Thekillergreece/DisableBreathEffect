# DisableBreathEffect

A mod for The Long Dark that removes the annoying 2D breath cloud that appears every few seconds when it's cold.

This breath effect is especially annoying in dark scenes, as it can completely obscure the vision of objects lying on the ground.
Moreover, the breath effect is literally just rendered on top of the rest of the game. So if you move your "head" (the camera) around,
the breath you've just exhaled will magically follow you!

Finally, if you're using an older or integrated graphics card, installing this game may noticeably improve the performance of your game.
